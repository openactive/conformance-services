# Developers' Overview

OA Conformance Services have been designed with developers in mind in two ways:

### Improving the Services

Over time, multiple groups of developers will be working on building up the services code; this documentation is intended to help developers get familiar with the systems, code and structures so that they can start work as quickly as possible. 

### Adapting the code for other products

The code in this repo is openly licensed, and has been developed with the hope that developers interesting in using OA data will be able to get started quickly. To that end, the code here is designed to be a template for how other systems might collect and process data, and could be used as part of a wider application. 

Although the code has relatively minimal configuration exposed via conf files, most things that are set in variables can be changed safely - such as the location of the DataCatalog, or which normalisation pipes run.
