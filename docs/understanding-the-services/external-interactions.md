# External Interactions

The services have been designed with two key interactions in mind: someone who publishes a feed and who wants to understand how useful it is and how to make it better, and someone who might want to work with OpenActive data. 

### Data Publishers

For publishers, the status page provides a simple overview of how useful for particular applications a certain feed is. This is presented in a straightforward table, and is kept up-to-date so that improvements are reflected in a timely manner. 

For technical staff working with those publishers, a detailed feed of the errors that the system encountered is made available. 

### Application Developers

For developers who might want to use OpenActive data, the services are designed to reduce the effort required to understand what is possible with OA data, and to provide template code for an application that might need to obtain OA data. The live RPDE feed is intended to provide a ready source of ready-to-use data for experimenting with, although not for integration into a real application.
