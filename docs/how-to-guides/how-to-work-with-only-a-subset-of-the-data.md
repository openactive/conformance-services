# How-to: Work with only a subset of the data

If you're in the development stage of a project, then running your code with all the data that's available can be unncessarily slow. There are a few ways in which you can work with just a subset of the data. 

  
See [How-to: Get data from only some publishers](how-to-get-data-from-only-some-publishers.md) for a specific case, or see the page for each stage of the [Data Pipeline](../understanding-the-services/stage/) for ideas.
